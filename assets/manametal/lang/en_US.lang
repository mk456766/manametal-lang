tc.research_text.aetherTC4R2=Sky Coal
tc.research_page.aetherTC4R2=During sky adventures, you often find these yellow ores. Besides making torches, they can be used to create other items through infusion - very useful indeed.

dark_of_the_true32.1="Have you come to this elven forest trying to save your race?" said the person in white armor. "Unfortunately, you cannot save your kingdom. The outcome was determined the moment you touched black magic." "No, there must be a way. If we can find news of the elves or dragons, they must have the power to counter the out-of-control black magic!" I retorted unwillingly. "The dragons cannot save you, neither can the elves. You will disappear from this continent." "Although I'd like to give you a quick end, we happen to need someone with enough power to continue controlling and nurturing the black snake in the days to come." Then he told me the truth about the ancient thulium cave and black magic, and these things made me despair.
dark_of_the_true32.2="Who... are you exactly?" After a long silence, I finally uttered this question. Hearing this, he removed his helmet, and I was stunned when I saw his face... I knew him, his features matched those in that ancient painting in our castle, the portrait of the Elf King painted by others when the elves still inhabited this land... "No... this is impossible, who are you...?" "The White Knight of the Rose, Oberon"

career.point.use.17=Omniscient Holy Fruit: 
ItemPage.PG_WTR.0=April 9, 1267. I am the newly appointed Lizardman scribe. Two years have passed since the Great War began. After the Half-orcs banished us to this cave due to their fear and xenophobia, we have been surviving in this cavern daily, only able to tell day from night by a single ray of sunlight from the entrance.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.1=June 23, 1267. In this sunless cave, apart from native creatures, most of our food source has been limited to the scarce Ankaya Berries. Although they are rare and taste bitter, we seem to have no other choice. Only a few of our people continue to work on improving it or attempt to grow other crops.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.2=August 14, 1267 Today, some wanderers seemingly entered this cave by chance and exchanged some supplies with us. Through these traded materials, we managed to craft tools like fishing rods. Now we can try fishing in the underground lake using berries or meat scraps as bait.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.3=October 9, 1267 Our explorers accidentally discovered a mineral vein while searching for food. There appear to be resources like coal deposits. We attempted to mine some minerals using our brought tools for fire-making and trading. Fortunately, some smugglers care only about the deal's value, not our identity.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.4=November 13, 1267 We discovered a strange yellowish-green mineral in our mine. It resembles thulium ore but is very stable and contains magical properties. We named it ancient thulium. Although merchants consider these minerals worthless, we've preserved them for research.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.5=December 6, 1268 Some lizardmen discovered a gem-rich area while mining. The smugglers were satisfied with these resources and promised to bring us more useful supplies if we continue providing these minerals.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.6=May 8, 1269 We maintain our resource base by selling various minerals discovered in the mine while continuing to research the properties of ancient thulium. We found that ancient thulium ore shows good stability and defensive capabilities when used as building material.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.7=July 11, 1269 Some magic-using clan members were attracted to the magical properties of ancient thulium and attempted to craft staffs from it. They discovered that spells cast through ancient thulium staffs consumed less MP while producing stronger effects. After this discovery, some clan members received the lord's permission to research ancient thulium's magical properties.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.8=December 18, 1269 After months of research, scholars learned a unique magic that helps us build homes and tools, while easily defending against cave monsters. We also successfully created stable long-term light sources through this magic for the first time. We began trying to grow crops using these light sources, and things seem to be improving.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.9=October 22, 1270 Our trades with smugglers were eventually discovered. The half-orc army sealed the cave entrance, cutting off our trading routes with the outside world. Fortunately, our crop-growing attempts were successful and near harvest. If we use our remaining resources sparingly, we should be able to survive.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.10=August 1, 1271 The development of ancient thulium progresses well. We built a more complete furnace enabling us to refine purer ancient thulium and other minerals. Researchers also discovered that ancient thulium contains not only ordinary magic but also a special magical energy, which they are actively researching.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.11=March 27, 1272 Through researchers' dedicated efforts, we developed another magical energy source. We call it dark energy and developed black magic through it. While we don't know how dark energy came to be, black magic's powerful properties helped us create many beneficial inventions.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.12=January 6, 1273 After months of effort, we created numerous black magic technologies and spells. Through black magic, we're no longer troubled by food shortages. We built altars and began expanding our living space. I feel our development is progressing smoothly.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.13=October 24, 1274 With the maturation of black magic-powered furnaces, metallurgy, and forging techniques, we began using ancient thulium to craft numerous tools, weapons, and armor. We train our people and develop more black magic technology while building sturdy buildings and fortresses. Though we've grown accustomed to underground life, we all know that someday we must return to the surface and reclaim our sun.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.14=December 29, 1274 Our sorcerers used their black magic to destroy and successfully open the tightly sealed iron door at the cave entrance. After years of underground living, we saw the sky again. Thanks to the night and our careful actions, no one discovered this.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.15=January 3, 1275 Our army secretly organized troops and attacked the half-orcs that night. Accustomed to darkness, we successfully ambushed and eliminated a half-orc military camp under cover of night. By the time they noticed, they had lost many troops, while we suffered almost no losses thanks to our fine equipment and black magic.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.16=January 12, 1275 The next day, the unwilling half-orcs launched an attack, but our sorcerers were well-prepared. They were caught off guard by previously unseen magic and weapons, suffering heavy losses in this direct confrontation.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.17=January 22, 1275 Wearing our fine ancient thulium equipment and wielding black magic, we pushed the battle line forward step by step until the half-orcs were left with only their capital unconquered, and by then we were unstoppable.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.18=January 24, 1275 The half-orcs sent messengers to propose alliance terms, but our people who had suffered in the caves for nearly ten years were furious and vowed to completely destroy the half-orc nation. The negotiations ended in failure.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.19=February 5, 1275 Our night raid forces conducted a decapitation operation and successfully assassinated the half-orc leader and several leadership figures.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.20=February 6, 1275 With the loss of several leaders, the half-orcs fell into chaos. They had completely lost their will to resist. We easily captured their capital, eliminated many half-orcs and kept a small number as slaves.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.21=February 10, 1275 We returned to this land and became its rulers. For continued development, we still venture into the ancient thulium caves, continuing to develop our original territory and collecting more minerals and ancient thulium to expand our influence.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.22=June 10, 1275 This can be called our golden age. We used ancient thulium to build great temples and towering statues, and used black magic to achieve most of our goals. The other three races seemed intimidated by our mighty power and began to focus on opposing us, but under the powerful force of our technology, even with all three races focused on fighting us, they could only bring the war to a stalemate.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.23=January 24, 1276 To break through the situation, the sorcerers in the Black Magic Council began researching more powerful black magic. They proposed to Masadabah lord the need for living subjects for experiments. After some consideration, the lord only agreed to regularly supply livestock and occasionally provide serious criminals, prisoners of war, and slaves for experiments. The council seemed dissatisfied with this result.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.24=February 21, 1276 The Black Magic Council seems somewhat restless. Some people reported finding strange creatures or forms around their research facilities, and prisoners and some vulnerable people began to disappear from the prisons.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.25=March 5, 1276 Unnatural monsters began appearing around the research facility, and disappearances became commonplace. Masadabah lord finally ordered a halt to further black magic research, but our people, long oppressed, seemed intoxicated by this magic that had freed us from suffering. Though they agreed on the surface, underground research continued to be discovered, and the Black Magic Council gained increasing support from our people.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.26=May 9, 1276 A hidden altar was discovered deep in the caves, where sorcerers had already secretly conducted multiple rituals to summon monsters or perform sacrifices. Upon discovery, Masadabah lord was enraged and ordered the immediate closure of the altar and punishment of these scholarly sorcerers. However, the Black Magic Council opposed this, believing it was the only way to lead the lizardmen to their peak. The people's opinions began to split, with some following the lord, but more leaning towards the Black Magic Council.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.27=May 16, 1276 After the Black Magic Council once again ignored Masadabah lord's opinion and forcefully conducted a ritual with majority support from the people, Masadabah lord left the empire with some loyal followers, stating he would seek ways to bring things back under control.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.28=May 9, 1276 As mastery of black magic grew, the scholars opened a portal and made a pact with the demons who came through, exchanging blood sacrifices for power. These vows were carved into stone tablets for the people to remember, called the Dark Oath.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.29=June 10, 1276 Council members became increasingly extreme, conducting large-scale sacrifices and summoning more demons. The ancient thulium caves became increasingly occupied by demons, and many demons left the caves causing destruction and sacrifices, but the council remained obsessed, ignoring it all.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.30=July 10, 1276 The summoned monsters grew stronger. Although some still-lucid lizardmen organized militia to continuously attempt to repel these monsters, with the increasing number and strength of monsters, our casualties began to mount.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.31=September 28, 1276 We can no longer resist these monsters and have begun hiding in less conspicuous places. The Black Magic Council has started hunting us resistant lizardmen, and we have no choice but to hide everywhere.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.32=January 14, 1277: The council leader Raima has completely lost his sanity. He controlled numerous monsters to capture all our people, regardless of their support for him, and led the monsters back to the caves. We were taken back to the caves, and I don't know what they plan to do. But perhaps this is the end of the lizardman race.
ItemPage.PG_WTR.33=February 21, 1277: This will probably be my last record. Raima and his council have conducted numerous rituals and experiments in the caves. I can feel the evil magic in the cave slowly corrupting my mind, and I hear strange voices constantly speaking to me. I think I'm the last one still conscious. I must record all of this, hoping that someday someone will find this record, which documents our former glory and witnesses our fade into darkness...

ItemPage.ItemAncientDocuments.12=After the Dark Council returned to the royal city, they conducted numerous rituals and research. They gradually became obsessed with the power of ancient gods, and the corrosive nature of black magic led to an increase in lizardmen losing their minds, until after the Connection Ritual, almost all lizardmen in the royal city lost their sanity.

GuiManaBook.Foreword1.tile.1=Foreword
GuiManaBook.Foreword1.1=Observing and documenting the knowledge of all things is my mission. My name is Strawberry Dione. In this world, the gears of time never stop for anyone, every minute and second flows away. As a scholar, I take pride in recording all things in the world, but the world changes constantly, and every moment is worth recording. Even if these sights have long been forgotten by people, at least future generations can know of their existence through these records. The knowledge of the world is vast as smoke and sea, and what I have recorded is merely the tip of the iceberg. I have grown old and can no longer record in person, and the last thing I can do is leave these notes and move forward to complete my final quest.
GuiManaBook.Foreword1.2=I hope that when future generations learn from these notes, they will not be limited to words, but use their own eyes to explore, traverse every corner of the world, whether past, present, or future. Learning is endless, and we should constantly expand our horizons and knowledge. --Written by Strawberry Dione
GuiManaBook.Foreword1.photo.1=Foreword
GuiManaBook.CreationLegend1.tile.1=Legend of Creation
GuiManaBook.CreationLegend1.1=In ancient times, when the world was still in void and chaos, countless unknown beings were born in this chaos, they were the first ancient existences in the world. As time passed, these beings fought endlessly in undefined space and time, devouring each other. Finally, most of the ancient lives perished, dispersed, or were sealed in the struggle. After long years, their scattered souls, fragments, and energy gradually transformed into various elements, nurturing the embryonic form of all things in the world, forming a primitive and complex world - the "Realm of Origin". This marked the beginning of the Age of Origin.
GuiManaBook.CreationLegend1.2=Long after the ancient beings vanished, a second batch of conscious creatures gradually emerged in the Realm of Origin. They originated from the powerful energy left in the world, I call these groups the "Originals". The Originals lived in this primordial world for a long time, until some particularly powerful Originals had an idea: to create their own world within the Realm of Origin.
GuiManaBook.CreationLegend1.photo.1=Legend of Creation
GuiManaBook.CreationLegend2.tile.1=Legend of Creation
GuiManaBook.CreationLegend2.1=These powerful beings divided the primordial realm into several dimensions, carving their own worlds within each dimension. The greatest Primordial Dragons - the 'Dragon of Virtue' and the 'Dragon of Sin' - created our world within these dimensions.
GuiManaBook.CreationLegend2.2=As time passed, the world gradually filled with life. We revered the Primordial Dragons as the creators of all things and had frequent interactions with them. With the development of fire, settlements, and civilization, our world gradually matured, finally entering the Mythological Era and beginning a new chapter.
GuiManaBook.CreationLegend2.photo.1=Creation Legend
GuiManaBook.Magic1.tile.1=Magic in the World
GuiManaBook.Magic1.1=In our world, various energies are everywhere, existing within minerals, air, plants, and living beings. These energies can be manipulated by organisms to produce desired effects, which we call magic, spells, or rituals. Most organisms contain an internal energy called "MP". Through specialized training, beings can use MP to cast various spells. From basic healing spells to powerful fireballs, MP is a highly versatile energy. Depending on the race, beliefs, habits, and culture of beings, MP can manifest in various ways. Additionally, there exists an external energy called "mana energy" in the world. This energy is widely present in minerals, plants, and magical springs. Mana energy is essentially refined energy, purer and more efficient than raw magical energy, but it has lost the ability for fine control and cannot be used to cast spells.
GuiManaBook.Magic1.2=The major races of the overworld have developed many complex rituals and equipment through the development of mana energy, enabling people to use mana energy to improve their lives. Whether it's MP or mana energy, these energies are deeply rooted in our world, shaping every aspect of our civilization.
GuiManaBook.Magic1.photo.1=Magic in the World
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor1.tile.1=Inheritors of Wisdom
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor1.1=Since the creation of all things, the world has given birth to various races and cultures, including reptiles, birds, small animals, and of course, races possessing wisdom. These beings have the ability to write history, create languages, communicate with other races, and develop civilizations - we call them intelligent races. They are distributed throughout the world, with each race having its own way of life and civilization. Humans are the most numerous race in the world and can be found almost anywhere, but their basic abilities are also among the lowest of all intelligent races. Humans rank below average in physical abilities, crafting skills, and magical affinity. Most humans are far inferior to high-tier races like the winged or dragonborn, and they struggle to excel in specific fields compared to other races.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor1.2=Humans possess extremely powerful potential - a small portion of human individuals can demonstrate exceptional levels in different fields. This means that while humans have lower average abilities, some can break through these limitations and demonstrate power and influence comparable to other races. "If you ask about the weakest race, humans would definitely be the most common answer. But if you ask about outstanding races, humans would certainly be on that list as well."
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor1.photo.1=Human Race
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor2.1=Dragons are the earliest creations of the Genesis Dragon and their descendants. Dragons broadly include Ancient Dragons, Dragonborn, and Magic Dragons, though generally only the Dragonborn are considered members of the intelligent races.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor2.2=Ancient Dragons are massive dragons who inherited the most blood from the Genesis Dragon. While they possess immense power, they are few in number and mostly extremely proud. The vast majority of Ancient Dragons act alone, rarely interacting with other races, and some even pose a threat to other species.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor2.photo.1=Dragon
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor3.1=The Dragonborn are the only dragon race considered among the intelligent races. They inherited partial dragon bloodlines and form the largest dragon population. Dragonborn generally possess the ability to change their form, freely switching between human and dragon forms. Though they typically prefer human form, they have unique Dragonborn characteristics and dragon transformation abilities that other races cannot learn. Most Dragonborn can partially transform parts of their body into dragon features like claws, wings, or tails. Some powerful Dragonborn can temporarily transform into complete dragons. While they lack the raw power of Ancient Dragons, their transformation advantages and high intelligence have made the Dragonborn another prosperous race in the world.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor3.2=Magic Dragons inherited only a small portion of dragon bloodlines and are typically smaller in size. They possess neither the power of Ancient Dragons nor the wisdom and transformation abilities of Dragonborn. They often work alongside other races as companions. Though Magic Dragons' power may not match other intelligent races, they remain an important group that cannot be ignored.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor3.photo.1=Dragon
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor4.1=The Elves are a noble race who prefer to live in harmony with nature and have notably higher magical affinity than humans. Their most distinctive physical feature is their long ears, with some possessing butterfly-like transparent wings. Though peace-loving and generally unwilling to use force, this doesn't indicate weakness. Elves possess extremely keen hearing and senses, excel at reconnaissance and guerrilla tactics, and are incredibly agile. The original elves were the High Elves led by the first Elven King Lapulas, who played a crucial role during the Ancient War and became an extremely powerful race. After Lapulas's abdication, the elves disagreed about future leadership, ultimately following different leaders and going separate ways.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor4.2=Today's elves are mainly divided into three branches: the Sun Elves who dwell in the Aether, the Wood Elves who live in forests, and the Dark Elves who reside underground. Each now has their own culture and leaders. While the three races generally govern themselves separately, they maintain means of communication for important matters.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor4.photo.1=Elf
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor5.1=The Naga are an underwater race, and due to their habitat, continental records about them are very scarce. What is known is that the Naga have developed a powerful civilization underwater. They have two physical variants: the fish-people who show Naga characteristics across most of their body, and the merfolk who only have tails or limited Naga features. Despite their different appearances, both branches consider each other as kin.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor5.2=As the only intelligent race underwater, the Naga have almost exclusive access to most undersea natural resources. This has enabled them to build powerful civilizations and cities underwater. The abundance of oceanic resources and environmental differences have made trade with other races unnecessary for them.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor5.photo.1=Naga
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor6.1=Dwarves are short but sturdy and robust. They excel at precise craftsmanship and share a strong connection with the earth, allowing them to adapt well to cave environments. This makes them outstanding miners, blacksmiths, and architects.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor6.2=Dwarves primarily inhabit mountainous regions. The abundant mineral resources in their mines make them major exporters of metal materials and processed goods. The cool spaces within their mines have also led to the development of sophisticated brewing techniques. Their diverse and high-quality dwarven ales are another well-known racial specialty alongside their various crafted products.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor6.photo.1=Dwarf
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor7.1=Half-orcs possess robust builds with impressive physical capabilities among intelligent races. Their remarkable strength and endurance allow them to adapt and survive in both scorching deserts and freezing mountains. Due to scarce resources, half-orcs rarely advanced much in crafting. Instead, when they were initially divided into different tribes, they often fought among themselves, necessitating combat training from an early age - a practice that continues even after tribal unification.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor7.2=Modern half-orc tribes have found ways to survive without conflict. They mostly inhabit snowy mountains, using their natural physical advantages to gather precious resources from desolate or dangerous areas for trade with other races. They also cooperate with dwarves, serving as excellent laborers in larger mines.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor7.photo.1=Half-orc
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor8.1=Beastmen are fur-covered races primarily dwelling in forests and plains. While they have very low mana sensitivity, they possess excellent senses and agility, making them natural hunters and gatherers who can move and track with ease. The beastmen currently consist of five main branches: wolf, cat, rabbit, deer, and fox. In ancient times, lizardmen were also part of the beastmen but were expelled after a certain incident.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor8.2=Beastmen's superior senses make them passionate gourmets. Their excellent sense of smell and taste are used not only for hunting and gathering ingredients from nature but also for detecting the flavors and characteristics of each ingredient, ultimately combining them into wonderful dishes.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor8.photo.1=Beastman
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor9.1=The Winged are an intelligent race residing exclusively in the Aether paradise. They resemble humans but are distinguished by their unique pure white wings. The Winged are an extremely powerful race, arguably one of the most combat-proficient among the intelligent races of the main world. They can retract or extend their wings at will. While most Winged have one pair of wings, in extremely rare cases, some are born with two pairs, possessing greater magical power and strength than ordinary Winged. Although records mention six-winged beings, apart from accounts of the first Divine King, no other cases of six wings have appeared in either historical records or among current members. The Winged are a closed and religious society, ruled by a supreme leader called the Divine King and a council of High Priests. The Divine King maintains a personal guard called the Divine King's Guard, composed of the strongest warriors among the Winged who are absolutely loyal to the Divine King, with their captain possessing extraordinarily powerful abilities.
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor9.photo.1=Winged
GuiManaBook.WisdomInheritor9.2=They had several conflicts with the Sun Elves who also lived in the Aether. Until one year, a half-blood of Sun Elf and Winged lived among the Winged and eventually became the divine king's guard. After her identity was discovered, it became an opportunity for peace negotiations between the two races. The Winged and Sun Elves finally reached an alliance agreement and lived together in the blessed land of the Aether.
GuiManaBook.BattleOfTheAncients1.tile.1=Battle of the Ancients
GuiManaBook.BattleOfTheAncients1.1=The Primordial Dragons - "Dragon of Virtue" and "Dragon of Sin" initially worked together to claim a territory from the Primordial Realm and carved out their own world. The Dragon of Virtue first carved out springs and forests, followed by the Dragon of Sin who carved volcanoes and lava. The Dragon of Virtue created white clouds and rain, while the Dragon of Sin made thunder and storms. As time passed, they gradually developed different views on the world's direction. The Dragon of Virtue believed the world should develop continuously to pursue peace and perfection, while the Dragon of Sin thought moderate destruction should be added to create other possibilities. The conflict between the Primordial Dragons intensified until it finally led to war.
GuiManaBook.BattleOfTheAncients1.2=The Dragon of Sin reached an agreement with another new god who shared the Primordial Realm, offering part of the world after victory in exchange for allowing demon armies from the demon realm to invade and cause destruction. The Dragon of Virtue, unwilling to see the world arbitrarily destroyed, chose to bestow part of its power to several of the most promising intelligent races in the Primordial Realm, hoping they could fight against the Dragon of Sin together. The Hero King Arthur was among them.
GuiManaBook.BattleOfTheAncients1.photo.1=Battle of the Ancients
GuiManaBook.BattleOfTheAncients2.1=The two Primordial Dragons engaged in a final battle at the continent's center. After an earth-shattering war, the champions chosen by the Dragon of Virtue defeated the demon generals from the demon realm and activated the planned seal, successfully sealing away the Dragon of Sin. The continent was shattered by the war's immense power, splitting into several landmasses and countless islands, becoming the world we live in today.
GuiManaBook.BattleOfTheAncients2.2=Shortly after the great war, the Dragon of Virtue vanished. Some believe it no longer wished to intervene in worldly affairs, while others think it entered hibernation due to severe injuries from the war. No one knows where the Dragon of Virtue went. Nevertheless, the mythological era led by the two Primordial Dragons came to an end, and people gradually rebuilt from the war-torn world, entering a human-centered era: the Renaissance Era.
GuiManaBook.BattleOfTheAncients2.photo.1=Battle of the Ancients
GuiManaBook.IoniaiSland1.tile.1=Ionia Island
GuiManaBook.IoniaiSland1.1=Ionia Island is a massive island located at the world's center. In ancient times, this island was also home to elves, dragonborn, and half-orcs, but following the return of demons to the island, major wars, and the Lizardman Dynasty incident, only humans, beastmen, and dwarves remain as residents. Before the Ancient War, people lived on a giant continent called Ionia. Until the end of the Ancient War, the Ionia continent was torn apart by the Primordial Dragons' conflict, splitting into several continents and countless islands. Ionia Island was at the center of the battle, retaining large amounts of magical power from the war. Combined with the legacy of Hero King Arthur passed down through generations, today's Ionia Island has become a place that nurtures countless adventurers. Due to its central location in the world, it has been highly developed.
GuiManaBook.IoniaiSland1.2=Beneath Ionia Island lies a massive cave known as the Ancient Thulium Ruins. Historically, this cave contained vast amounts of dark energy and was discovered by the lizardmen. This ultimately led to the Lizard Dynasty Incident on the island. Today, while the dark energy in the cave isn't as powerful as before, due to its potential mind-controlling abilities, further exploration of the cave remains restricted, especially the inner royal city in its deepest part which requires special approval for entry.
GuiManaBook.IoniaiSland1.photo.1=Ionia Island
GuiManaBook.IoniaiSland2.1=After the Ancient War, conflicts among different races on the island increased due to prejudice and conflicting interests. They stopped sharing technology and gradually began oppressing each other. One day, a militant group of lizardmen infiltrated a demon portal fortress, broke through the guards with armed forces, and attempted to break the seal.
GuiManaBook.IoniaiSland2.2=Although this incident didn't cause irreversible damage, it indirectly led to increased conflicts between different races, causing the dragons and elves to decide to leave the island. Shortly after these two powerful races departed, the half-orcs initiated wars against other races, followed by the other three races launching wars against each other, plunging the island into a long period of conflict.
GuiManaBook.IoniaiSland2.photo.1=Ionia Island Warfare
GuiManaBook.AboutMonster1.tile.1=About the Demons
GuiManaBook.AboutMonster1.1=People know little about the demons. We know they first appeared during the Ancient War, allied with the Sin Dragon. During the war, they invaded our world through demon portals that appeared worldwide. After the Ancient War, most portals were sealed, though new portals attempting invasions continued to appear for some time before eventually ceasing. After the Mythical Era, a group of lizardmen heretics on Ionia Island attempted to open these demon portals. They briefly succeeded in opening one of the great gates, but instead of the usual endless stream of monsters, a powerful demon entity emerged, eliminated all lizardmen present, caused severe damage to the surroundings, and then vanished.
GuiManaBook.AboutMonster1.2=It left only a warning against future attempts and a destroyed portal. The reason for this demon's reaction remains unknown, but this incident led to the island's lizardmen being viewed as a dangerous race by other inhabitants, with elves and dragons subsequently leaving the area. This event became known as the Second Return of the Demons.
GuiManaBook.AboutMonster1.photo.1=About the Demons
GuiManaBook.FutureWorries1.tile.1=A Dark Future
GuiManaBook.FutureWorries1.1=Our world seems peaceful yet is full of threats. Even though various forces have achieved peaceful communication today, we cannot let our guard down. To this day, we still discover different threats worldwide, sometimes powerful monsters or even ancient dragons, the Immortal Cult, or dangerous organizations like the Occultists. We still don't know if the demons will return for a third time. As I worry, people are often poor at maintaining vigilance during peaceful times. The long peace seems to have made people gradually complacent. We no longer regularly discuss and simulate strategies for demon invasion responses, nor do we actively seek effective methods to maintain the seals.
GuiManaBook.FutureWorries1.2=Our future looks bright, but it seems to be shrouded in darkness. My readers, please stay vigilant and arm yourselves, for you never know when the next danger will come. When something threatens our existence or even the world's survival, I hope you will be prepared to fight for the world.

GuiManaBook.fishing11.tile.1=Fishing Basics
GuiManaBook.fishing11.1=Once you have prepared and equipped your fishing rod, choose a pond or water source to complete your fishing preparation. Cast the float into the water, and when a fish bites, the float will sink. At this point, you can catch the fish and start fishing. After the fishing interface appears, right-click the mouse to move the float to the left, while the fish will struggle to move the float to the right. Keep the float in the blue area to continuously drain the red prey's stamina until it's completely depleted for a successful catch. Using better fishing rods, bait, or hooks can increase fishing power and speed up prey stamina drain. Be careful, once the float enters the red zone, the yellow fishing gear durability will start to decrease. Fishing gear durability represents the fishing line's tension limit; once depleted, fishing fails. Better fishing lines or rods can increase gear durability. The white time value will continuously decrease, and if time runs out, the prey will escape and fishing fails. You can control the yellow marker using left and right arrow keys, moving it to the fish icon to stop time decrease. Better fishing rods or floats can also increase the time duration.
GuiManaBook.fishing11.2=Fishing is not a simple task. Through manipulating the float and wrestling with the prey, you finally have a chance to catch it. Different water areas will yield different fish species, and some species can only be caught in specific waters!
GuiManaBook.fishing11.photo.1=Fishing Basics
GuiManaBook.fishing21.tile.1=Ocean Treasures
GuiManaBook.fishing21.1=Sometimes what you catch isn't a fish, but might be a treasure chest or a message in a bottle. These treasures can bring more valuable rewards and potentially better fishing gear.
GuiManaBook.fishing21.2=Treasures are not easy to catch. Increasing your fishing level can improve the chance of hooking treasure.
GuiManaBook.fishing21.photo.1=Ocean Treasures
GuiManaBook.fishing31.tile.1=King of the Deep Sea
GuiManaBook.fishing31.1=Occasionally while fishing, you may encounter powerful Fish King level prey with extremely high HP, which usually requires a significant amount of time to catch.
GuiManaBook.fishing31.2=Fish Kings provide more experience compared to other fish species, but they are harder to breed and have lower spawn rates.
GuiManaBook.fishing31.photo.1=King of the Deep Sea
GuiManaBook.fishing41.tile.1=Fish Basket
GuiManaBook.fishing41.1=When fishing in the wild, if you want to keep fish alive and bring them home for breeding, you'll need a fish basket. The fish basket is a simple device that keeps fish alive, and when destroyed, the fish inside won't disappear, making it convenient for transport.
GuiManaBook.fishing51.tile.1=Fish Breeding Basics
GuiManaBook.fishing51.1=Besides direct use, fish caught can be placed in fish ponds for breeding. To build your own fish pond, you first need at least a 3x3 water source. Place the fish pond below the water, ensuring each seagrass block is in water and the blocks beneath the seagrass must be anything except water or air. Just place live fish in and add fish bait, and the fish will lay eggs and produce more offspring on their own!
GuiManaBook.fishing61.tile.1=Bait
GuiManaBook.fishing61.1=While fishing, you can use bait to reduce waiting time and increase the rate at which prey loses HP when hooked. Bait can be crafted using fish and string, or other meat products. Sometimes, better mixed bait can be found in treasures, which provides stronger fishing power.
GuiManaBook.fishing01.tile.1=Basic Fishing Gear
GuiManaBook.fishing01.1=Before fishing, you need a fishing rod. Craft it using sticks and string, or use iron rods to make a better one. Crouch and use the fishing rod to open the fishing gear inventory. If you have accessories, they can improve fishing efficiency or increase experience and fishing coins.
GuiManaBook.AncientKey1.tile.1=Ancient Key
GuiManaBook.AncientKey1.1=As the Wither Supreme's miserable howl faded away, its body gradually dissipated, leaving behind only a key. Legend says the Wither Supreme was the true ruler of darkness, sustained by an incredibly powerful core within. Perhaps this key is that very core! The key's immense power resonates strongly with something mysterious in the distance. According to the final chapter of the legend, the key can awaken the long-dormant "Dark Oath". The awakening of the Dark Oath will summon creatures that dominate darkness and unlock the mysteries of the unknown darkness...
GuiManaBook.SummonEvil1.tile.1=Evil Summoning
GuiManaBook.SummonEvil1.1=While exploring the world, you often pass through places where thousands of troops are stationed, seemingly from a different world than ours. They are the fanatical cult organization - the Rose Crusaders. They love and worship darkness, willing to become martyrs for it, persecute others, and commit unspeakable acts. They are naturally dark, despicable, treacherous, and cunning, with few having enough power to defeat them. After obtaining the Ancient Key, it seems as if some external force is trying to break into this space. By building a damaged portal and empowering it with the key, vast legions will charge through, howling madly. Use the Ancient Key to open the Rose Gate, but beware - once opened, an army of 100,000 will pour through. Gather your companions to face this threat together...
GuiManaBook.PurpleBlood1.tile.1=Purple Blood of the Demon Serpent
GuiManaBook.PurpleBlood1.1=A peculiar purple blood remains in the weapons left by the Knight. According to legend, the Knight was seen as a Blasphemous Knight for slaying the Demon Serpent - a deity worshipped by ancient races. After obtaining the Demon Serpent's blood, the blood in the Blood Pool began to bubble and boil, eventually reaching a frenzied state. Perhaps throwing the Demon Serpent's blood into the Blood Pool could summon this lost ancient god. After defeating the BOSS, you will obtain the "Dark Fragment"
GuiManaBook.TheLoseDark1.tile.1=The Lost Darkness
GuiManaBook.TheLoseDark1.1=After the ancient god's fall, the darkness remaining in its body condensed into Dark Fragments. This darkness is unprecedented, infinitely distant, untouched and unexplored. Perhaps this is the key to opening another door of darkness. The Blood Pool seems to boil with enthusiasm due to this powerful darkness, even extending blood hands attempting to devour it. Perhaps throwing it into the Blood Pool could obtain even greater darkness. After defeating the BOSS, you will obtain the "Sky Key"
GuiManaBook.dungeon11.tile.1=Ruin Adventure
GuiManaBook.dungeon11.1=During adventures, you'll discover many dungeons or ruins of varying sizes resembling castles. According to historical records, the previous era was an age of adventure, producing many famous explorers who ventured forth to explore the world. Some established outposts for long-term exploration and research. Others built dungeons to study monsters.
GuiManaBook.dungeon11.2=As time passed, the monsters of old and the treasures of the ancestors remained, though their owners have long since departed.
GuiManaBook.dungeon11.photo.1=Ruin Adventure
GuiManaBook.dungeon21.tile.1=Universal Temple
GuiManaBook.dungeon21.1=During exploration, you may occasionally feel intense energy flows. These energies ultimately flow towards a magnificent temple. The temple's stone tablets record its history - in ancient times, it served as an energy collector, absorbing specific types of energy through corresponding temple structures and storing these vast amounts of power. However, with the outbreak of war, years of conflict and the passage of time, the methods of operating the temple have been lost. The immense energy has caused the monsters dwelling within to gradually evolve, becoming an even greater threat...

GuiManaBook.dungeonKIT1.tile.1=Small Ruins
GuiManaBook.dungeonKIT1.1=These ruins were built by unknown ancient people, and typically contain a normal treasure chest
GuiManaBook.dungeonKIT1.2=These ruins can appear in various places, including caves
GuiManaBook.dungeonKIT1.photo.1=Small Ruins
GuiManaBook.CrystalProtection1.tile.1=Crystal Protection
GuiManaBook.CrystalProtection1.1=The Crystal Protection Altar is a structure built by ancient races who believed crystals could bring blessings. When activated, this crystal will continuously spawn monsters. To activate the protection crystal, simply right-click the core in the middle with a Nether Star
GuiManaBook.CrystalProtection1.2=During the Crystal Protection Altar challenge, blocks cannot be placed or destroyed
GuiManaBook.CrystalProtection1.photo.1=Crystal Protection Altar
GuiManaBook.ThuliumDungeon1.tile.1=Ancient Thulium Ruins
GuiManaBook.ThuliumDungeon1.1=An ancient world inhabited by a mysterious ancient race. Legend says they possess incredible powers, waiting for brave adventurers to uncover...
GuiManaBook.ThuliumDungeon1.photo.1=Ancient Thulium Ruins
GuiManaBook.ThuliumDungeon1.2=The monsters in the Ancient Thulium Ruins are very powerful. Please prepare your equipment before exploring. The following pages will introduce how to assemble the portal and craft the teleportation wand.
GuiManaBook.ThuliumDungeon2.1=The Ancient Thulium Ruins wand must be used with a complete ruins portal. Its durability is very low, so use it carefully to avoid wasting resources.
GuiManaBook.ThuliumDungeon3.1=The Ancient Thulium Ruins portal frame is the core block of the entire portal. You need at least 10 blocks to complete the portal (similar to Nether portal).
GuiManaBook.ThuliumDungeon4.1=To assemble the portal, arrange the blocks as shown in the image, then right-click the center with the wand to open the portal.
GuiManaBook.ThuliumDungeon4.photo.1=Ancient Thulium Ruins Portal
GuiManaBook.ThuliumDungeon4.2=Go forth, adventure and collect treasures!
GuiManaBook.UndeadTomb1.tile.1=Undead Tomb
GuiManaBook.UndeadTomb1.1=Beneath the earth, there lies a vast bedrock that separates the erosion between worlds. Though impenetrable, the bottom layer of bedrock is shrouded in dense dark energy, with wails echoing endlessly, comparable to hell itself. Through the resonance of black magic, lost knowledge has once again awakened. This is an evil magic, an evil discovery, an evil crossing. We will use the power of bedrock to break the seal and cross that impossible gate. After activating the gate with energy, evil corruption rushes forth, with the heavy clatter of skeletons filling the space. That is the resting place of the undead, the ancient tomb of the lost ones. It was once a place of silence, a place of darkness, where no pure beings are allowed to survive, for any pure being's intrusion would gradually be affected by the whispers of the undead, slowly corrupting until they too become impure, never to return. They despise everything, they loathe everything, they hate everything, they fear powerful pure beings, they are not wise ones, they cannot distinguish between the essence of pure and impure.
GuiManaBook.UndeadTomb1.photo.1=Undead Tomb
GuiManaBook.UndeadTomb1.2=Indeed, they never see all things, they are skeletons who have experienced death, that place is the lost but reawakened Undead Tomb, which will transform into a pit of impurity, devouring those who dare to intrude.

GuiManaBook.bossBlock71.tile.1=Sealed: Roar of the Nine Heads
GuiManaBook.bossBlock71.1=At that distant end, the sky gate long dominated by spider webs stands unwavering, guarding the sky. The Sky Key in hand created heavenly music with the gate, but soon after, a mountain-shattering roar broke this beauty. One pair, two pairs, four pairs, eight pairs, nine pairs - that was the ultimate fear, the ultimate melancholy, the ultimate anger. Nine pairs of amethyst-like eyes stared at me as if to pierce through my being. The sun, moon, even the starry sky and mountains were all obscured by its heads. A great serpent with nine heads, wrapped in its own phantoms, slowly approached me. Its renewed roar announced the beginning of battle, and also proclaimed that our new adventure would begin again.
GuiManaBook.bossBlock81.tile.1=Chronicle: Inscription of Runes
GuiManaBook.bossBlock81.1=As the Sky Key sparkled beneath the stars, gradually the starry sky was devoured by a shadow, growing larger and larger, as big as a meteor. With a boom, smoke filled the area, with only the center of the mist glowing, inscribed with language I couldn't understand. After a low humming sound, its light gradually changed from blue-white to yellow, and as the humming grew stronger, the light turned to a crimson glow. After a final high-pitched screech, it charged at me, carrying an intense aura of sorrow...
GuiManaBook.bossBlock91.tile.1=Aria: The Eternal Guardian
GuiManaBook.bossBlock91.1=If I had one more day, month, year, or even century of life, I would willingly imprison myself here to exchange for my lord's freedom and salvation. My wings conduct a storm symphony to protect our home; my scales perform a radiant waltz to illuminate our realm; my roars sing a death aria to slay those who dare intrude. If I had time, I would sacrifice everything to prevent all tragedies, slaying both gods and buddhas to eliminate all threats to the sky. Though eternal love is noble, it often blinds one from seeing the truth - only by seeing through everything can one find liberation.
GuiManaBook.WorldOfAncient1.tile.1=The Ancient World
GuiManaBook.WorldOfAncient1.1=During my adventure, distant whispers occasionally reached my ears. When I turned to look, an enormous gate floated before my eyes, slowly opening. It revealed another forest, lush and verdant, with birds singing in harmony. Here exists neither the chaos nor the noise of the human world; this place belongs only to peace and tranquility. Every moment spent here is wonderful... Or so I wanted to say. The lush green forest is merely a hiding place for the deceitful; the birds' songs are death ballads mocking foolish intruders; the beauty here is as treacherous as tempting fruit; the tranquility is a harbinger of the coming storm. This is the primitive ancient world that existed before even our ancestors were born.
GuiManaBook.AutoJadeCraft1.tile.1=About Enhanced Gems
GuiManaBook.AutoJadeCraft1.1=Enhanced gems are mysterious substances, resembling gemstones but possessing incredible mystical properties. These enhanced gems can be obtained from treacherous environments or from defeating BOSSes, and can later be identified at the identification table and embedded to improve weapon quality.
GuiManaBook.InsMagicJade1.tile.1=Enhanced Gem Identification
GuiManaBook.InsMagicJade1.1=A simple identification table used to identify the quality of enhanced gems. Each identification result seems to vary. To obtain better enhanced gems, you must use a gem grinding machine.
GuiManaBook.addMagicJade1.tile.1=Enhanced Gem Inlaying
GuiManaBook.addMagicJade1.1=A workbench where you can place weapons and corresponding enhanced gems. To perform inlaying, simply place an identified weapon and identified enhanced gems. Each weapon can only be fitted with up to 3 different colored enhanced gems.
GuiManaBook.gemCraft1.tile.1=Gem Synthesis
GuiManaBook.gemCraft1.1=Gem synthesis, as the name suggests, is the fusion of various gems. Fusing crushed gems will yield higher quality gems that can be used as accessory materials or as materials needed for enhanced gem upgrades. Notably, different types of gems can be used for synthesis, and the product will be intermediate between the materials used. This way, gem conversion can be achieved through reduction agents.
GuiManaBook.updateMagicJade1.tile.1=Enhanced Gem Upgrade
GuiManaBook.updateMagicJade1.1=To upgrade enhanced gems, you must use this equipment and insert the required gems for upgrading. Each type of enhanced gem requires different gems for upgrading.

GuiManaBook.lizard_story_11.tile.1=Story of Ancient Race - The Rise
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_11.1=We lizardmen were supposed to be of the same kind as the half-orcs, but since the alliance began to fall apart, the half-orcs started oppressing us. We thought things would gradually get better, but after the war broke out, the half-orcs ordered us to pioneer into an unknown massive cave. I think they were just using pioneering as an excuse to eliminate what they saw as unstable elements while saving resources for the war.
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_11.photo.1=The Rise
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_11.2=This massive cave was dark, with only a few plants or monsters emitting light to lure their prey. I wasn't sure if we lizardmen could survive in this cave, but I didn't want our race to vanish. We must survive, and someday we will return to the surface to seek justice from those half-orcs who banished us.
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_21.tile.1=Story of Ancient Race - Crisis from Another World
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_21.1=Survival conditions in this great cave were harsh, and this environment bred extremely dangerous creatures and plants adapted to this place. Diseases we had never seen on the surface even appeared. Although some crops could grow in this dark underground lacking light, their food production efficiency was far from satisfactory. As time passed, more and more companions were sacrificed, but we finally learned to deal with and hunt the creatures in the cave. We also found native edible plants, and the food crisis was somewhat relieved.
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_21.photo.1=Crisis from Another World
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_21.2=However, this alone is not enough to survive in this world full of dangers. We have now found naturally defensible terrain for our camp and temporarily resolved the food crisis, but we cannot go on like this forever. We must find more ways to adapt to this cave, and... ways to return to the surface and reclaim our glory.
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_31.tile.1=Story of Ancient Race - Time of Transformation
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_31.1=Countless years have passed, and the war on the surface seems to be still ongoing. We have begun to survive successfully in this world. The birth of new generations and the discovery of cave resources have gradually led us to prosperity. Our scholars discovered a new type of energy never seen before in the cave: "dark matter". We found that dark matter could produce chemical changes when in contact with many other substances, which led to our successful development of dark matter lamps and later more ways to use it. Furthermore, our miners discovered a mineral we named ancient thulium while collecting cave ores. This mineral is similar to the thulium ore we had seen before, but it emits an unknown magical power. Even more amazingly, when dark matter interacts with ancient thulium, it can draw out the magical power within the ancient thulium, creating unprecedented magic, which we named "black magic". As time passed, we successfully used these things to survive and continuously expand our power in the cave. We forged equipment made of ancient thulium, researched spells with powerful destructive force, and tamed dangerous creatures in the cave. After decades of hardship, it's time for us lizardmen to return to the surface.
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_31.photo.1=Time of Transformation
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_31.2=We reopened the exit of the great cave and charged at the half-orcs with our weapons. The half-orcs were overwhelmingly defeated under our mighty power. We killed their leader, destroyed their nation, and established our own Lizard Dynasty.
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_41.tile.1=Story of Ancient Races - The Golden Age
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_41.1=After returning to the beastman territory, our priests built a portal to the ancient thulium realm within our domain. We traveled between both worlds and shared resources. With our newfound power and resources, we no longer limited ancient thulium to weapons alone. Having gained immense power, we began using it in construction - houses, statues, and tools made from ancient thulium could be seen everywhere. Gradually, ancient thulium became integrated into our daily lives, and our civilization's progress became more evident day by day. Moreover, without external threats, our priests devoted themselves entirely to researching black magic, developing many powerful spells and applying them to weapons, preparing for the distant future. They even combined black magic with ancient thulium to create metals superior to ancient thulium itself. The golden age of the lizardmen had arrived. We ruled over many races and possessed resources from two worlds. We had every reason to believe that under our leadership, the beastman race would become unprecedentedly powerful - the greatest glory for the beastman race.
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_41.photo.1=The Golden Age
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_41.2=We quickly replaced the half-orc regime and established the Lizard Dynasty. Our speed was so swift that the other three races couldn't react in time. Our strength was more than sufficient to face them. We named the great cave the Ancient Thulium World and had our priests build portals for quick travel between worlds. Now we possessed resources from both worlds and mastered black magic which they didn't have. We began attacking the other three races, plundering their resources, forcing them to unite against our attacks despite their previous conflicts. Meanwhile, our scholars remained in the Ancient Thulium World, continuously researching black magic and ancient thulium, creating increasingly powerful spells. The lizardmen entered an unprecedented golden age. We believed that soon we would unify the entire continent and ultimately become the most powerful race in this land.

GuiManaBook.lizard_story_51.1=We believed that soon we would unify the entire continent and ultimately become the most powerful race in this land. That's how it should have been. When did it begin? Our scholars' research became increasingly extreme, and our soldiers' conditions on the battlefield worsened. Some began deserting the army to act independently, and civilians started disappearing or dying. Perhaps we should have stopped then, but by the time we realized it, it was too late. For their black magic research, scholars captured our own people for experiments. Others developed an inexplicable obsession with the Ancient Thulium World, with more and more choosing to live there permanently. Finally, scholars began summoning strange creatures... or rather, demons. The situation ultimately spiraled out of control, with the majority of lizardmen returning underground, and we could no longer maintain our advantage in war. In the end, we returned underground and were gradually consumed and destroyed by black magic. Perhaps we once had a chance - if we had made peace with the half-orcs upon returning to the surface, if we had stopped when we discovered the impurity of black magic, if we had lived peacefully with the other three races instead of dreaming of conquest.
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_51.photo.1=The Fall of the Golden Empire
GuiManaBook.lizard_story_51.2=However, it was all too late. Black magic, which initially brought us prosperity and hope, ultimately brought us destruction and despair.
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true11.tile.1=Black Magic - The Dark Truth
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true11.1=The main difference between black magic and regular magic is that black magic is based on "transactions." Most black magic requires rituals and sacrifices using creature parts like horns and hair. When black magic use exceeds its limits, it begins to take from the caster. The caster gradually loses rationality - those with strong minds can maintain sanity, while those with weaker minds become madmen who research black magic at any cost.
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true11.photo.1=Black Magic - The Dark Truth
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true11.2=You may have noticed that the essence of black magic isn't evil. Its users are like those negotiating with a dangerous merchant. Those who use it properly and know their limits can safely use black magic; otherwise, they're consumed and become slaves to it.
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true21.tile.1=Story of Masadabah I
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true21.1=We, who were exiled by the beastmen hundreds of years ago and now abandoned by the half-orcs in this war, have successfully emerged from underground, and the Lizardman Dynasty has gradually gotten on track. But something seems not quite right... The proposals from the Magic Council have become increasingly radical, even starting to experiment on criminals. We seem to have never seriously considered why black magic is so powerful. Powerful magic usually requires either powerful energy or masterful control from the caster to be possible. But black magic clearly violates this principle... Or perhaps it doesn't, and is gradually extracting its price somewhere we don't know about. This has made me increasingly worried about whether the excessive use of black magic would cause certain consequences, and if one day black magic goes out of control, whether we lizardmen could still harness it.
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true21.photo.1=Story of Masadabah I
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true21.2=After I rejected Yaert's proposal in the Magic Council to use criminals for experiments again, I secretly assigned my trusted followers to monitor the members of the Magic Council, hoping their research would not cross the appropriate boundaries.
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true31.tile.1=Story of Masadabah II
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true31.1=Things have gradually spiraled out of control. Raima from the Magic Council eliminated those who opposed him in the council, transforming it into the Dark Council under his leadership. They no longer obey me, and the other lizardmen seem to have begun worshiping black magic as well. They have started secretly using rational tribesmen as sacrifices and test subjects for black magic. Things have unknowingly become beyond my control alone. I must leave the kingdom to seek help, to find someone or something that can fight against black magic and assist me in bringing my people and kingdom back on track. We decided to head west to the forest where the elves live to search for clues. Although we had to pass through beastman territory, we eventually reached the elven forest ruins after several days. There we encountered a person wearing white armor. Even though I couldn't see their face clearly, I could still feel their presence... that was the pressure possessed by a true master. They seemed somewhat surprised to see us but appeared to quickly understand the current situation. They raised their right hand, drew a sword from a suddenly appearing wormhole, and killed my trusted follower in an instant.
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true31.photo.1=Story of Masadabah II
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true31.2=As I turned to flee, I heard a snap of fingers, and in the next instant, the forest around me disappeared, replaced by a purely black space with only me and them.
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true41.tile.1=The Lost Rose Protocol
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true41.1=You, King of the Lizardmen, shall serve as a sacrifice to seal and nurture the Black Serpent, imprisoned in the high tower. If one day you successfully overcome the Black Serpent under the corruption of black magic, I shall grant you a key - a method to restore your Lizardman race.
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true41.photo.1=The Lost Rose Protocol
GuiManaBook.dark_of_the_true41.2=But if you cannot resist the black magic, you will be forever corrupted by its power, falling into darkness to become the final sustenance for the Black Serpent, remaining in the tower until others come to release you.
GuiManaBook.ThuliumInfo1.tile.1=The Truth of Thulium
GuiManaBook.ThuliumInfo1.tile.2=§2Secret Characteristics
GuiManaBook.ThuliumInfo1.1=Thulium, though similar in appearance to gold but slightly paler, harbors dark energy within. This energy has existed since ancient times but couldn't withstand the erosion of time. Gradually, thulium no longer possessed powerful dark energy and fell from notice, but little did they know it was the key to a new world, the gateway to new milestones. How to restore this powerful dark force again? By infusing some mana energy? No, that's not enough. We need purer energy to stimulate the darkness hidden in its core, such as: dark matter.
GuiManaBook.ThuliumInfo1.photo.1=Ancient Thulium Ruins
GuiManaBook.ThuliumInfo1.2="Perhaps we shouldn't always cling to those old things of the past. When the Genesis Dragon gave us new knowledge, we should follow Its footsteps and relearn everything anew." - Dark Priest Yaret
GuiManaBook.DarkEnergy1.tile.1=Powerful Dark Energy
GuiManaBook.DarkEnergy1.tile.2=§2Dark Energy
GuiManaBook.DarkEnergy1.1=Perhaps due to the absence of sunlight, a lot of dark matter has formed here. This dark matter carries immense dark energy that can catalyze the dark energy within thulium, creating what we call "ancient thulium". Moreover, those terrifying boss monsters possess powerful dark matter within their bodies, which might allow us to generate endless energy sources.
GuiManaBook.DarkEnergy1.photo.1=
GuiManaBook.DarkEnergy1.2="There might be other ways to generate darkness, but let's stick with this for now! It's the fastest method." - Black Magic Scholar Keklama
GuiManaBook.DarkAltar1.tile.1=Dark-Gathering Altar
GuiManaBook.DarkAltar1.tile.2=§2Ancient Altar
GuiManaBook.DarkAltar1.1=The magical energy in this world is unstable, thin in some places and uncomfortably dense in others. While these energy concentrations change with space and time, they follow a cyclical pattern. To better control the energy here, we decided to darken it and improve upon the previous altar design by infusing it with dark energy. First, inject dark energy-infused thulium ingots into the altar to let it adapt to darkness, then add dark matter to alter the altar's nature, gradually darkening the magical energy around it. Finally, and most importantly, place the more concentrated dark fragments into the altar to power it.
GuiManaBook.DarkAltar1.photo.1=Dark Altar
GuiManaBook.DarkAltar1.2=At last, the altar emanates dark radiance. Though it appears evil and terrifying, it brings warmth and dawn to us Lizardmen. The dark-gathering altar has become sturdy and nearly indestructible due to its powerful energy. Thus begins the Dark Age. "You might wonder why we resort to dark energy, which is supposedly untouchable. In truth, it's not that we choose to use dark energy, but rather that darkness is all that remains in this world, and it's up to us to forge a path to light." - Doomsday Sage Raima
GuiManaBook.DarkGenerator1.tile.1=Dark Initiation: Dark Energy Device
GuiManaBook.DarkGenerator1.tile.2=§2Ancient Energy
GuiManaBook.DarkGenerator1.1=Dark force is beginning to gather! However, this is temporary. We must create instruments to maintain the energy operation through the injection of dark energy. What happens if we don't? Nothing serious, the dark force will just dissipate. To continue our research, an endless supply of dark force is necessary.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkEnchanting1.tile.1=Transcription of Forbidden Codex: Dark Enchanting Table
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkEnchanting1.tile.2=§2Ancient Enchantment
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkEnchanting1.1=The old world's enchantment techniques have reached saturation and are difficult to develop further! But when we attempted to combine enchantment arts with dark energy, something unexpected occurred. Those enchantment texts continuously consumed dark energy until they could absorb no more. Upon observing these enchantments again, I discovered that the enchantment power had become much stronger. Perhaps we could try to darken the entire enchanting table.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkEnchanting2.1=After creating enchanted items with a normal enchanting table, I placed them in the dark enchanting table. As I expected, the entire enchanted item became more powerful. Perhaps we can use this formula to continue growing.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkEnchanting2.photo.1=Dark Enchanting Table
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkEnchanting2.2=This equipment can increase the level of enchantment effects on items, but each item can only be used once.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkPerfusion1.tile.1=Energy Enhancement: Dark Infusion Station
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkPerfusion1.tile.2=§2Ancient Charging
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkPerfusion1.1=Since we can darken enchantments, perhaps we can try to darken items themselves. Of course, it failed! Dark energy is currently difficult to sustain on items for long periods, but it can at least attach temporarily. Even though the attachment is temporary, the power enhancement it brings is enormous.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkPerfusion2.1=However, care must be taken during use, as this energy seems to deplete faster when the user is injured or using it, though these drawbacks are insignificant compared to the power enhancement effect.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkPerfusion2.photo.1=Dark Infusion Station
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkPerfusion2.2=This equipment can infuse dark energy into weapons, greatly increasing attack power. However, the effect will gradually fade with use, eventually requiring re-infusion.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkTattoo1.tile.1=Light in the Dark - Dark Totem Altar
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkTattoo1.tile.2=§2Ancient Totem
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkTattoo1.1=Deeper darkness comes from the unknown, with mysterious energy circling around the altar that even our priests and sages find difficult to observe. We call the manifestation of these energies "Turken".
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkTattoo2.1=Controlling these energies isn't difficult, but the challenge lies in their unknown nature. They seem to only resonate with accessory items - armor and weapons cannot resonate with these Turken. This resonance law might be beyond our current ability to comprehend.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkTattoo2.photo.1=Dark Totem Altar
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkTattoo2.2=This device can infuse dark energy into totems, gaining random different abilities with each infusion. Multiple infusions may be needed to obtain better abilities.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkSummon1.tile.1=Ritual of the Abyss Call - Dark Summoning
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkSummon1.tile.2=§2Ancient Summoning
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkSummon1.1=When we become powerful enough, perhaps it's time to summon those ancient BOSS! Darkness represents the unknown, but these BOSS are beyond darkness itself. They also control certain secrets - black magic might only be improved by defeating these BOSS.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkSummon2.1=Dark energy is often associated with death, but this is only half true. Life and death are interconnected, so darkness is also linked to life. Through the catalysis between materials and dark energy, we can summon these BOSS. Of course, I cannot guarantee whether these summoned beings won't kill their summoner right away.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkSummon2.photo.1=Dark Summoning Array
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkSummon2.2=This device can use dark energy to summon BOSS monsters
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkItemMake1.tile.1=Sound of Dark Iron: Dark Replicator
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkItemMake1.tile.2=§2Ancient Crafting
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkItemMake1.1=Dark matters should best avoid contact with primitive things. Darkness exists within darkness - it is the essence of darkness. Therefore, dark tools are best crafted on dark workbenches to maintain their purity, and perhaps even enhance their strength.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkItemMake2.1=Using dark energy, due to its unknown nature, this mysterious and unstable energy can be used to create almost anything in our mortal realm.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkItemMake2.photo.1=Dark Replicator
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDarkItemMake2.2=This device can use dark energy to replicate various basic items
GuiManaBook.Darkfurnace1.tile.1=Application of Dark Magic - Dark Energy Furnace
GuiManaBook.Darkfurnace1.tile.2=§2Ancient Smelting
GuiManaBook.Darkfurnace1.1=As development continues, our warehouse's fuel supplies are running low! To prevent future problems, perhaps we should try converting dark energy into fuel. Why can coal, blaze rods, or wood burn? Fire energy is the key element. What happens when fire energy mixes with dark energy? Of course, it failed! The two couldn't blend properly, but as we increased the proportion of dark energy, something magical happened - dark energy consumed the fire energy, and at that moment, fire energy continued to be absorbed! Gradually, dark energy became filled with fire energy and transformed into fuel. So we modified the furnace to allow dark energy to be infused with fire energy when inserted. Fuel problem solved! The furnace could be further modified - we discovered that dark energy floats upward during combustion, so we collected this rising energy and incorporated it into spells. The results were fascinating: when we burned fifty items, we produced seventy-five products. With this, the dark energy furnace's structure was complete. This size seems just right for these items.
GuiManaBook.Darkblastfurnace1.tile.1=Wonders of Darkness - Dark Blast Furnace
GuiManaBook.Darkblastfurnace1.tile.2=§2Ancient Forging
GuiManaBook.Darkblastfurnace1.1=We moved the Nether portal to the ancient thulium world, where we obtained large amounts of iron. Imagine what happens when iron mixes with dark energy? Direct mixing? No, not enough - we need a more advanced furnace, specifically a blast furnace. The modification principle is similar to the furnace, but this time we needed to use a much larger amount of dark energy. Finally, our persistence paid off - dark steel was formed! Its energy is several times stronger than iron, even exceeding tenfold! Perhaps we can input some materials to obtain even more powerful resources. Combined with the dark energy furnace, we can maximize our material efficiency.
GuiManaBook.MMMbook1.tile.1=Magic Metal Dictionary
GuiManaBook.MMMbook1.tile.2=§2Share Your Wisdom

GuiManaBook.ManaEnchanting2.1=Many wizards infuse their experience energy into enchanting tables to imbue tools or weapons with magic, a process called enchanting. Although it has been popular for a long time, each enchantment doesn't always yield the desired result, which is why this ritual was developed. While mana enchanting still requires experience energy, each enchantment will definitely achieve the desired goal as long as you complete this altar structure.
GuiManaBook.ManaEnchanting2.2=To use mana enchanting, first place the item in the Mana Enchanting Table, then right-click to select enchantments. Repeated selection increases the enchantment level but cannot exceed the preset maximum. After selecting at least one enchantment, right-click the Mana Enchanting Table with a Concentrated Magic Wand to begin. It requires mana energy.

To complete the multi-block structure, you need to prepare: Magic Runes X32, Altar Stone X33, Altar Rune Stone Core X8, Altar Pillars X12, Beacon X1, Mana Crystal X4
GuiManaBook.BedrpckMaker1.2=Once the structure is successfully built, place the Bedrock Formation Core on the beacon to begin manufacturing.

Gui.MagicMana=Mana Energy Index
GuiManaBook.ful.time.book=Mana Energy: 
GuiManaBook.aboutME1.tile.1=About Mana Energy
GuiManaBook.aboutME1.1=In the past, your devices had the function of inputting magic dust and other items to generate energy. However, as magic devices increased, magic dust consumption became too high and management became more inconvenient. Now, the mana energy system has been invented, which reconcentrates magic dust into purer mana energy. Through monuments and cores, it can be quickly transmitted to nearby equipment, making it not only more convenient but also more economical with magic dust.
GuiManaBook.aboutME1.2=To use mana energy, you first need to craft a mana energy generator, then place the required equipment above the generator.

GuiManaBook.SkyStele1.tile.1=The Founding Spirit of Aether: Azure Inscription
GuiManaBook.SkyStele1.1=The azure stele stands in the Abyss Cave, beneath the thulium altar, bearing the final words of one who still yearned for freedom. Though Masadabah stands dormant once again, before his slumber, he told me the secrets of the Azure Inscription. Long ago, there was one with glowing white eyes who called himself the Founding Spirit. He gifted us this stele and told our ancestors about its mysteries. But whether cursed by some mysterious force, whenever we pass on this knowledge, it's as if our souls are drained. My father collapsed in my arms right after telling me about the inscription. This is painful knowledge, like a flood crossing everything, explaining dark secrets, world truths, our rise, and our fall. Our rise was but an ephemeral existence in the vast sea, merely a dot on the inscription. While the lizardmen were indulging in black magic technology, I had already seen through the entire ugly Abyss Cave through the mysterious energy of the inscription - truly living up to its name, a cave of no return, a cave where once you sink, you cannot rise again. Perhaps the Founding Spirit who gave us the inscription was one who knew the world. Following my method, perhaps unexpected things will happen!
GuiManaBook.AetherEnergy1.tile.1=Awakening of the Sleeping Elves. Aether Temple
GuiManaBook.AetherEnergy1.1=Why are there no ancient sigils in Laputa? Simply put, matter is a burden to beings above elves. To convert matter into "elements" used by elves, we need to build an Aether Temple to summon sleeping elves. These sleeping elves can call forth all dormant elements within matter. The combination of elements can form a "sigil," and different sigils can be combined to create various things. This cycle continues, establishing the vast Laputa. Laputa is merely a profound philosophy built upon elements and sigils. Elves don't need material things they consider as worthless as dirt. They are mysterious beings who only need powerful ether energy to catalyze elements and operate Laputa. Those evil creatures that once plagued the world are sealed within the temple. Perhaps we can have the sleeping elves awaken them again, and defeat them completely.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityWeaponStar1.tile.1=Gift of the Star Elves. Astrologer's Framework
GuiManaBook.TileEntityWeaponStar1.1=The stars in the sky are countless, each representing a soul, and each constellation representing a village. Stars are like distant magic arrays, and through their constellation power, those mysterious lost powers can be imbued into weapons. When you pray devoutly, those great constellations will answer your prayers and grant what you seek. Through ether energy, we can transmit my response to the other side of the constellation, and the other side will resonate with us through this Astrologer's Framework. Each weapon will be bound to different constellations, and by strengthening the connection with that constellation, you can enhance the blessings granted by the constellation, including powerful forces, unique techniques, or the inheritance of certain knowledge and skills.

GuiManaBook.TileEntityTeleportBlock1.1=Nymphs, the elves dwelling in Laputa's fairy realm, love to communicate through whispers with heroic individuals, sharing lost myths. They appear pure and adorable. But don't be fooled by their cuteness - they control a technology called the Aether World. The Aether World is a mirror world full of antimatter where physical beings would instantly disintegrate upon entry, except for elves like Nymphs who possess high fairy realm energy. Perhaps we can achieve some miraculous feats by borrowing the Nymphs' power. A Nymph's Whisper is a transparent jewel that Nymphs gift to those they admire. It contains highly concentrated Nymph fairy energy, allowing free rapid transportation through the Aether World, like a portable wormhole.

GuiManaBook.TileEntityFlyMagic2.photo.1=Wind Walker Structure
GuiManaBook.TileEntityGilded1.tile.1=The blessing of wealth fairies. Golden House Structure
GuiManaBook.TileEntityGilded1.1=Misers can be found everywhere in the world, and fairies are no exception. Wealth fairies love shiny things like gems, metals, treasures, and money. They also love elaborate magic circles. Apart from their money-loving personality, wealth fairies come from wealthy backgrounds, with generations of profitable businesses, so they know a thing or two about gilding techniques. Perhaps we can attract them through the Golden House Structure. The Golden House Structure will call upon wealth fairies to gild equipment, which can temporarily provide extremely high performance improvements to equipment. But don't forget, they are misers - unless you've earned their trust, don't overuse it. There are quite a few people who have gone bankrupt because of wealth fairies.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityGilded2.1=Armor, tools, weapons, or any enchanted items can be gilded. Simply place items containing gold value, such as gold blocks, gold ore, gold ingots, or gold nuggets below, and the gold value will be stored in the altar using ether energy.

Having wandered for years, he enjoys bathing with fellow wanderers, exchanging knowledge and discussing tales. Through the mysterious hot spring lamp, you can summon his presence. Conversing with the Hot Spring Spirit effectively helps relieve the pressure from adventures and regain courage for new ventures. Before entering the hot spring, the spirit performs a bath prayer, which grants bathers energy for true spiritual relaxation and complete rejuvenation.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityEffectWater2.1=Place materials in the device to activate the holy spring's power. Bathing in the spring grants corresponding effects. Spring materials can be Philosopher's Stone, Golden Nether Star, Chaos Crystal, Soul Essence, or Hourglass, each producing different effects.

Once freed, it began destroying everything in sight without discriminating friend from foe. The Crusaders subsequently deemed it a failure and permanently sealed it within the tower. "This result was both excitingly successful and unacceptably failed."

He ordered his priests to prepare a summoning ritual, planning to trade the nation's vast treasures with other beings in exchange for immortality. The ritual succeeded, and Thanatos appeared before the king and priests. The king wished for immortality, and Thanatos granted it. He pulled the entire Golden Kingdom into a dimension of his creation, turning its people into immortal servants - mindless, desireless, eternally building mazes in Thanatos's space. The king achieved his wish in an unexpected way, and the Golden Kingdom vanished forever.

GuiManaBook.Dragon021.tile.1=Attribute Check
GuiManaBook.Dragon021.1=Right-click a dragon with a bone to check their attributes and talk with them. Remember to talk to dragons frequently, as this helps increase their intimacy. Also, dragons are afraid of being alone!
GuiManaBook.Dragon031.tile.1=Dragon Riding
GuiManaBook.Dragon031.1=Place a saddle on the dragon's back to ride it. Left-click a saddled dragon to mount it, and shift to dismount. While riding, you can fly.
GuiManaBook.Dragon041.tile.1=Feeding/Breeding
GuiManaBook.Dragon041.1=Give dragons different meats or fish to increase their intimacy and make them willing to help collect resources. Better food allows dragons to work longer. Giving a tamed dragon golden apples or any apples will allow it to breed with another dragon and produce a dragon egg. The dragon egg will hatch after 10 minutes, and the hatched dragon will be a baby dragon. Note that baby dragons will lose their owner if the owner is not nearby.
GuiManaBook.Dragon051.tile.1=Dragon Expedition Team
GuiManaBook.Dragon051.1=After defeating the Shadow Dragon King, you can obtain the expedition block. Use this equipment to guide a dragon team into a magical space for exploration.

GuiManaBook.Dragon061.1=Well-fed dragons will be willing to collect resources for their masters. Different dragon boxes can be used to select the types of resources to collect by placing them near the dragon. However, dragons are generally better at producing gold. Their alchemy can also produce money or spirit power, but this is much slower than producing gold, and the overall efficiency is related to the dragon's intimacy level. A dragon can work for multiple dragon boxes simultaneously, but this will reduce collection efficiency.
GuiManaBook.boss151.tile.1=Evil Oath - Dark Knight
GuiManaBook.boss151.1=As the Wither Supreme's miserable wail fades, its body gradually dissipates, leaving only a key behind. Legend has it that the Wither Supreme was the true ruler of darkness, with an incredibly powerful core sustaining its existence - perhaps this key is that core! The immense power emanating from the key creates a massive resonance with something mysterious in the distance. According to the final chapter of the legend, the key can awaken the long-dormant "Dark Oath". The awakening of the Dark Oath will summon the creatures that dominate darkness and unlock the mysteries of the unknown darkness...
GuiManaBook.boss161.tile.1=God of Chaos - Storm Serpent
GuiManaBook.boss161.1=Among the weapons left by the Dark Knight, there remains a peculiar purple relic. In legend, the Dark Knight was seen as a blasphemous knight for slaying the ancient races' revered god - the Serpent. After obtaining the Serpent's Soul, the blood in the blood pool begins to bubble and boil, eventually reaching a frenzied boil. Perhaps throwing the Serpent's Soul into the blood pool could summon that lost ancient god. After finally defeating the BOSS, you can obtain the "Dark Fragment"
GuiManaBook.boss171.tile.1=Lost Darkness - Red-Eyed Evil Dragon
GuiManaBook.boss171.1=After the ancient god's fall, the darkness remaining within its body coalesced into the Dark Fragment. This darkness is unprecedented, far-reaching, untouched, and unexplored darkness - perhaps this is the key to opening another door of darkness. The blood pool seems to boil with passion due to this powerful darkness, even extending blood hands trying to devour it. Perhaps throwing it into the blood pool could obtain even greater darkness. After finally defeating the BOSS, you can obtain the "Sky Key"
GuiManaBook.boss181.tile.1=Crimson Faith - Rose Colossus
GuiManaBook.boss181.1=
GuiManaBook.BOSSSUMMON1.tile.1=BOSS Summoning

Note that the surrounding terrain must be flat and have a clear view of the sky. You can use candles of any color to build the altar, and find witch runes in the Undead Tomb or Ancient Thulium Ruins.
GuiManaBook.BOSSSUMMON2.2=You must have a mana crystal in your possession to use BOSS summoning, otherwise summoning will not be possible.
GuiManaBook.BOSSSUMMON2.photo.1=BOSS Summoning Altar
GuiManaBook.ArmorStr11.tile.1=Special Equipment Enhancement
GuiManaBook.ArmorStr11.1=Some powerful equipment crafted with BOSS materials can be enhanced. Place the equipment in the enhancement table, and with sufficient materials, you can proceed with enhancement. However, all equipped gear must reach the same enhancement stage to trigger set effects.

GuiManaBook.boss191.tile.1=Remnant Light in the Night Mirror - Mirror Nightmare
GuiManaBook.boss191.1=No one knows how the Mirror Nightmare came to be. Since that devastating expedition, it began appearing in the palace mirrors and in Oberon's dreams. After the Elf King's departure, the nightmare completely lost control, forcing the elves to seal this mirror within the high tower, hoping it would never be released again.
GuiManaBook.boss201.tile.1=Ultimate Trial of the Dark Night - Doomsday Black Dragon
GuiManaBook.boss201.1=
GuiManaBook.SpellWand141.tile.1=Building Staff
GuiManaBook.SpellWand141.1=Building block by block is not only inefficient but also tedious. A simple magic staff can greatly increase building speed, allowing for the construction of larger castles. Use with caution - one wrong move means more time spent on demolition.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDestructionInfusion1.tile.1=Destruction Infusion
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDestructionInfusion1.1=Dark infusion can imbue weapons with the power of black magic, but we can make weapons more destructive by injecting purer black magic. Destruction infusion can enhance the black magic power attached to weapons. Although it still needs periodic replenishment, its destructive power against enemies has become far greater than before.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDestructionInfusion2.1=Destruction infusion can increase both the amount per infusion and the maximum capacity of dark infusion. When the remaining dark infusion charges exceed 100, it will grant Dark Consumption II effect, increasing damage even further.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDestructionInfusion2.photo.1=Destruction Infusion
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDestructionInfusion2.2="Fear not, soldiers. The black magic infused into your bodies will make you the most powerful warriors." - Dark Council Vice Chair Yaret
GuiManaBook.TileEntityForbiddenTotem1.tile.1=Forbidden Totem
GuiManaBook.TileEntityForbiddenTotem1.1=Dark totem is an amorphous mystical magic that gains power by injecting dark energy into totem stones. While normally the dark energy absorption is limited to avoid unknown side effects, purer and more powerful black magic can allow the totem to absorb more power. Although this may lead to unknown consequences, the Dark Council no longer cares about such matters.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityForbiddenTotem2.1=Forbidden totems can create more powerful totems than black magic totems. Different totems have their unique effects, but the stronger black magic makes them unstable and dangerous, potentially causing side effects.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityForbiddenTotem2.photo.1=Forbidden Totem
GuiManaBook.TileEntityForbiddenTotem2.2="These totems can be embedded anywhere - in inscriptions, watchtowers, or even in our bodies." - Dark Council Chair Raima
GuiManaBook.TileEntityChaosEnchantment1.tile.1=Chaos Enchantment
GuiManaBook.TileEntityChaosEnchantment1.1=Dark enchantment greatly enhances equipment's magical power through black magic, but the council was not satisfied with this. They obtained even greater power by offering countless souls born on sacrificial altars to the Ancient Gods, which they named Chaos Enchantment.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityChaosEnchantment2.1=Chaos enchantment can use soul power to further enhance the magic on items, increasing enchantment levels again. Only items that have undergone dark enchantment can use chaos enchantment.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityChaosEnchantment2.photo.1=Chaos Enchantment
GuiManaBook.TileEntityChaosEnchantment2.2="We shall become His most loyal swords." - Dark Council Third Seat Krama
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDemonReform1.tile.1=Demon Reformation
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDemonReform1.1=The Dark Council is obsessed with fusing various evil creatures into themselves, believing that with the power of the Ancient God, they can create perfect and powerful loyal servants.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDemonReform2.1=Demon Reformation allows the caster to gain a portion of dark creature abilities, but some overwhelmingly powerful abilities will cause the caster to suffer corruption. Using Demon Reformation requires at least 1000 levels of enchantment, which will be consumed after use. Only players with class level 100 will receive the Demon Reformation effect.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDemonReform2.photo.1=Demon Reformation
GuiManaBook.TileEntityDemonReform2.2="Yes, remove that part; then stitch this piece here; be careful with the technique when removing them, we're just one step away from creating our powerful executor." - Dark Council Third Seat Krama and his researchers
GuiManaBook.TileEntitySacrificialCeremony1.tile.1=Soul Sacrifice Ritual
GuiManaBook.TileEntitySacrificialCeremony1.1=The Soul Sacrifice Ritual originated from the Dark Council's absolute worship of the Ancient God. They built altars surrounding the Ancient God's fragments and continuously offered items to It. Their response was stronger faith and power.
GuiManaBook.TileEntitySacrificialCeremony2.1=The Soul Sacrifice Ritual grants effects through offering various items, producing different effects based on the sacrificed items - it could be temporary power or other precious items. You can only have one Soul Sacrifice Ritual effect at a time. Repeated use will override the current effect. When severely injured or killed, you will gradually lose the ritual effect until it completely disappears.
GuiManaBook.TileEntitySacrificialCeremony2.photo.1=Soul Sacrifice Ritual
GuiManaBook.TileEntitySacrificialCeremony2.2="If we offer our souls and give everything to that Great Being, what will It bestow upon us?" - Dark Council Vice Seat Yaret
GuiManaBook.TileEntityEvilMagicFormula1.tile.1=Evil Magic Formula
GuiManaBook.TileEntityEvilMagicFormula1.1=As our exploration deepened, we gradually discovered the source of black magic - a being full of destruction and evil, whose power could instantly destroy anything before Its eyes.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityEvilMagicFormula2.1=The Evil Magic Formula can further enhance dark power skills, giving dark power a second effect: Destructive Spread. Unlike self-enhancing dark power, Destructive Spread integrates black magic into other attacks, making enemies vanish under heavy bombardment of black magic.
GuiManaBook.TileEntityEvilMagicFormula2.photo.1=Evil Magic Formula
GuiManaBook.TileEntityEvilMagicFormula2.2="That Great Being will destroy everything in this world, and then our kingdom will be born in darkness." - Dark Council First Seat Raima
GuiManaBook.TileEntitySoulEnergyGenerators1.tile.1=Soul Energy Refinery
GuiManaBook.honeycomb1.tile.1=Beehive
GuiManaBook.honeycomb1.1=Beehives can be found in many places such as forests, snowy plains, and jungles. Different beehives drop varying amounts of bees and different queen bees. Collecting different species of queen bees is fundamental to beekeeping.
GuiManaBook.beehive1.tile.1=Basic Beehive
GuiManaBook.beehive1.1=Use saplings and fermenters to make tung oil, then use grinders, tung oil, and any logs to create moisture-proof logs. Moisture-proof planks can be combined with beehive frames to make beehives. The beehive is fundamental to beekeeping. Place bees and queen bees inside the beehive to begin beekeeping. The beehive needs flowers nearby for bees to collect nectar. When there are enough flowers and bees, they will help pollinate nearby plants during nectar collection, increasing plant growth speed.
GuiManaBook.queenbee1.tile.1=Understanding Queen Bees
GuiManaBook.queenbee1.1=Queen bee species vary depending on wild beehives, while attributes like vitality differ for each queen bee. Vitality affects the queen bee's lifespan and influences beehive operation. When a queen bee's vitality reaches zero, it dies and needs replacement for the beehive to continue operating. Attack attribute affects bee sting damage, resistance affects the queen's ability to resist mites, efficiency affects beehive work rate, productivity affects beehive product quantity, mutation chance affects larva mutation probability (mutations may add or reduce special attributes), and pollination speed affects the rate at which beehives accelerate plant growth through pollination.
GuiManaBook.beecultivates1.tile.1=Bee Cultivation
GuiManaBook.beecultivates1.1=Place larvae in the bee cultivation box with appropriate feed like honey or royal jelly, and they will eventually grow into bees or queen bees.
GuiManaBook.beebreedings1.tile.1=Queen Bee Breeding
GuiManaBook.beebreedings1.1=Place two queen bees in the bee breeder along with various plants and royal jelly to encourage reproduction. The offspring type depends on the input species, while larva attributes are randomly inherited from either queen bee.
GuiManaBook.beeseparate1.tile.1=Beekeeping Products
GuiManaBook.beeseparate1.1=As beehives operate, you can harvest various products including honeycombs, honey-filled combs, larvae, and pollen. Honeycombs can be processed into beeswax in grinders, which is one material for making candles. Honey-filled combs can be processed into honey in grinders. Honey is a non-perishable food that can be combined with any food to add sweetness and increase recovery amount, or made into propolis in juicers. All honeycombs, whether honey-filled or not, can be processed in the honeycomb separator, with products varying by honeycomb type.
GuiManaBook.pollen1.tile.1=Pollen
GuiManaBook.pollen1.1=Pollen is one of the beehive's products. Using pollen can increase the experience gained from production systems, and the effect of pollen will be enhanced as beekeeping level increases.
GuiManaBook.flowerfrom1.tile.1=Flower Farm
GuiManaBook.flowerfrom1.1=You can purchase flower grid boxes from the beekeeping shop using beekeeping coins. When you place any plant fertilizer like compost, bone meal, mineral fertilizer, or rotten food in the flower grid box, it will naturally generate flowers on nearby grass blocks, allowing better design of beekeeping farms.
